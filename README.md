###  ðŸ‘‹ Matti Picus

I am a developer at [Quansight Labs](https://labs.quansight.org/). I am a core maintainer of [Numpy](https://numpy.org) and [PyPy](https://pypy.org). and through that work have contributed to many other projects. In addition to contributing to python performance, I love teaching and helping new people learn how to use python and [how to make it fast](https://github.com/mattip/c_from_python).

Ask me about Open Source, getting involved in NumPy development, or when to use PyPy in the real world.
